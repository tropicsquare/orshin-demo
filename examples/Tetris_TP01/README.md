# TROPIC01 Tetris Demo

This project demonstrates secure, encrypted inter-device communication using the BB-protocol over Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR), featuring a Tetris game. The demo is based on [Tetris200lines by @najibghadri](https://github.com/najibghadri/Tetris200lines/tree/master) and extends it to run securely between two devices using the BB-protocol for encrypted communication.


## The Game Flow

- Whenever the Tetris game on the peripheral needs a new piece, it requests **two random bytes** from the central device.
- The central device generates these two bytes using the TROPIC01 hardware random number generator.
- The random bytes are sent back to the peripheral, **encrypted and authenticated** using the BB-protocol.
- The peripheral uses these bytes to determine the next Tetris piece, ensuring that the random number source is both secure and verifiable.

## How It Works

- The **peripheral** runs the Tetris game and requests random numbers from the central device to generate new Tetris pieces.
- The **central** device acts as a secure random number provider (and can be extended to provide other secure hardware-backed operations).
- All requests and responses are sent as encrypted messages using the BB-protocol. The message format is defined in `tropic_simple.h`.
- The communication flow is:
  1. Devices perform a secure handshake to establish a session key.
  2. The peripheral requests random numbers from the central device as needed for the Tetris game.
  3. The central responds with random data, all over an encrypted channel.

    Peripheral->>Central: Request 2 random bytes (encrypted)
    Central->>Central: Generate 2 random bytes (TROPIC01 RNG)
    Central-->>Peripheral: Send 2 random bytes (encrypted)
    Peripheral->>Peripheral: Use bytes to select next Tetris piece
```

## üîí Protocol Security

- **BB-Protocol**: demo uses the BB-protocol for secure, authenticated, and encrypted communication over Bluetooth L2CAP. The protocol is implemented in `bb-lib` and used in `central.c` and `peripheral.c`.
- **Encryption**: All communication between the central and peripheral devices is encrypted. A secure handshake establishes a session key, and all subsequent messages (including Tetris game data and random number requests) are encrypted and authenticated.
- **Communication Channel**: The devices communicate over Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) using L2CAP sockets. The channel is protected by the BB-protocol, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.


### Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This demo is for educational and demonstration purposes only. Keys are hardcoded and should not be used in production.
- The communication channel is fully encrypted and authenticated using the BB-protocol.


## üöÄ Get Started!

### Prerequisites

To enable the BB-protocol on RPi, follow [BB-protocols over L2CAP for Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR)](../BB_BRINGUP.md) instructions.
To enable TROPIC01 secure element on the peripheral device, follow [TROPIC01 Secure Element Enablement](../TROPIC01_BRINGUP.md) instructions.

Install the **ncurses** library (for Tetris UI) on the peripheral device:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
  ```


### Build and Run

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```


> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** Depending on your Linux configuration, you may need to pair and "trust" the two devices using Bluez (`bluetoothctl`) before running the demo.

1. **On the Peripheral device:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/peripheral
   ```
2. **On the Central device:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./bin/central <mac_of_peripheral>
   # Replace <mac_of_peripheral> with the Bluetooth MAC address of the peripheral device
   ```

- The executables use hardcoded keys for demonstration purposes and are set up to run the BB-protocol session (bb-session). Pairing is assumed to have already happened.
